Real Life Reinforcement Learning - Multiple algorithm implementation on RetroArch Gameboy Super Mario Land

Implementations of RL (and others) algorithms on a real time game. I'm using the gameboy mario game runing on RetroArch but essentially any game can be used with 'some' tweaking.

I strongly suggest using a conda environment for all of this, prefferably for each algorithm as they can use different libraries, especially things like torch and tensorflow.
